                        <p> Computer software is truly the pinnacle of innovation. Recently, I have 
                        realized my dream to be a software engineer. I hope to eventually be able to code 
                        systems in place using new, exciting technology. The reason for this is because I 
                        am extremely curious about how systems like the Internet work. In addition, I enjoy 
                        trying new things and finding what I enjoy through trial and error. To achieve my goals,
                        I have started taking as many computer science classes as I can take, as I 
                        took one class this year (my junior year) and am planning to take two computer 
                        science classes my senior year. Last year, I took an introductory class to coding 
                        outside of school and instantly fell in love with creating new systems. 
                        My goal is to attend the Computer Science program at UC San Diego.
        
                        </p> <p>My creativity and curiosity help drive me in my coding journey. 
                        I have experienced many different activities, such as martial arts and piano. Along the way,
                        I have discovered that I desire to focus on coding. 
                        I plan to continue my coding journey by dedicating my junior and senior years to 
                        exploring the world of code and 
                        finding what coding languages I enjoy the most. Another thing I have been involved in is FMP, or Freshman
                        Mentorship Program. Guiding freshmen who are just as confused as I was in my freshman year 
                        has aided me in finding leadership qualities in myself.</p><p>
        
                        As a member of CSF and treasurer of the Crochet Club and Clay for Cancer Club, I have learned to be dedicated
                        to an organization. Ever since the age of 12, I cared for and tutored my brother while my parents worked
                        in San Francisco. I learned to be independent and how to teach myself what I do not understand. </p>
                        
                        <p>Overall, I am an extremely friendly and caring person, so do not be afraid to approach me!  I am 
                        curious, passionate, and willing to try new things. Thank you for your time.
                        </p>
